<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Veterinarian and Cabinetmaker are terrible, so they're gone right off the bat.  Likewise for Clay Deposit.  Axe and Clay Supports are kind of at odds with each other.  Axe only lets you make cheap wooden rooms, and Clay Supports are only good after renovating to clay.  I'd rather have the one that lets me get rooms earlier and saves me wood, so Clay Supports are gone.  Yeoman Farmer is only really good if you're going with some sort of super gimmick, or playing badly, in which case you're losing anyway.  I almost never keep him, unless I have Braggart.

Animal Breeder is very strong, and combined with Milking Hand, I have something I can use for a slow drip of food every harvest, if I fence early and get a pair of cows.  Early breeding cows are strong in general, and getting bonus food for keeping them is pretty good.  Axe makes fencing early viable, because I'll only need 2 wood per room.  Axe is also fairly easy to play in a 4 player game, because of the Reed/Stone/Food action.  This is going to be the core of my stategy.  

Animal Breeder is a strong ranching occupation, but I might go baking, because Sack Cart and Street Musician, but I probably won't play Street Musician.  It's not very strong, but if someone gets stuck without a food engine, you can kind of feed off of their desperation with it.

I'm playing in last position, so it's a good idea to have a minor improvement I can play for free, or close to free, so I can take starting player in the first round, and I don't really like Corn Sheaf, but I have a hand that could work for baking, and having the grain get passed around works more in favor of me as a baker than it does for ranchers.

But it's going to depend on the opportunities that arise.  If I can get a lot of clay early, I'm perfectly happy to ranch, and use the Broom to do something else.  Fair odds, I just play Goose Pond, Axe, and maybe Raft, and chuck everything else.

Even with Stone Exchange flooding the game with stone, I probably still won't have enough for Bakehouse, so discard it.

I think overall, having a few pass to the left minors (Corn Sheaf, Stone Exchange), is pretty good in combination with Broom, because I get initiative using them, and get to draw to replace them.

## Round 1

Action revealed: *Major/Minor Improvement*

Gareth plays Greengrocer.

Mike takes 3 wood (0W -> 3W).

Juan pays 1 food to play Patron (3F -> 2F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Gareth is going for early vegetables, and Juan played Patron.  Patron begs you to rush out occupations.  I anticipate Gareth is looking to combo with something like Schnapps Distiller, or Lettuce Patch, which requires 3 occupations to play.  So I anticipate a lot of competition over occupations early game, which should leave me fairly free to take resources that I need to get my housing and food engine started.

When Major/Minor comes out on the first round, a clay grab is safe, because there's no chance weird timing will allow someone else to grab clay and build a Fireplace before you have a chance to build it first.

My Animal Breeder plan requires a good amount of food to get started, so first Fireplace would be an asset.

Normally, you need wood or an occupation to get a good round 1 starting player action, but I have Corn Sheaf, so I'm okay with taking the clay, but I'll probably get stuck choosing between plowing a field and Day Laborer.  Chances are Mike's going to take starting player and make something out of wood, like a Fishing Rod or something.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 2 clay.
</div>


Gareth takes Starting Player, pays 2 food for Mini Pasture (2F -> 0F).

Mike plows a field (0 -> 1 field).

Juan takes RSF (reed/stone/food) (0R -> 1R, 0S -> 1S, 2F -> 3F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Normally, I'd sit on my clay for a while, as a deterrent to anyone else even thinking about taking clay, possibly opening the door for me to get a big clay grab later, but Gareth played Mini Pasture, so he can grab sheep and then try to figure out how to cook them later, so I have to have a Fireplace ready ahead of time and might have to grab them at as low as a pair, instead of letting them pile up for a while.

I don't know what to think about Mike plowing a field.  The options weren't terribly attractive, but RSF is generally more appealing.  I have to guess he wants to bake, or has Hobby Farmer, or something that will give him early vegetables.

Can't make anything of Juan taking RSF.  It's just a good all around option for the 7th action in the round.

Mini Pasture changes the game dynamic a fair amount.  Demand for wood ends up being a lot lower over the course of the game, since it's generating 16 wood if we all just use it once.  If it comes around fast enough, I might skip playing Axe.  Demand for food will be higher, too, though.  I might have to fight for a pair of sheep off the board.

Personally, I like to play Starting Player (SP) Mini Pasture when I want to use the starting player action to grab animals.  This kind of projection, on top of being starting player already is a little weird.  If I had to read something from it, I'd guess reed is important to Gareth.  Could be foreshadowing a Reed Hut.  I love Reed Hut, unless my opponents have it, in which case, I hate Reed Hut.

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Pay 2 clay to build Fireplace (2C -> 0C).
</div>


## Round 2

Action revealed: *Build Fences*

Gareth takes 2 reed (0R -> 2R).

Mike plays Brushwood Collector.

Juan takes 4 wood (0W -> 4W).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Mike's Brushwood Collector reduces the demand for reed, increases it slightly for wood, but overall works for him, with Mini Pasture in play.

Pretty normal plays.  I need to start collecting building resources.  If the opportunity presents itself, I can take SP with my second action and build a Raft and take 3 food and a reed.

If someone else takes SP, I can probably plow a field or something, to get ready to use my Corn Sheaf.  Planting in Stage 1 can set you up for supplementing late game with an oven, or emergency bakes in a Cooking Hearth.  If you get stuck playing in late position, it's not a bad option.

I don't think I'm going to have another opportunity at an occupation for a little bit, but I can't put off taking resources.  The sheep haven't shown up yet, so I don't think there's going to be a huge rush to use the Mini Pasture, so I'll need a bunch of wood if I want to use Animal Breeder.  
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 3 wood (0W -> 3W).
</div>

Gareth takes 1 grain, gets bonus vegetable (0G -> 1G, 0V -> 1V).

Mike pays 1 food to play Wood Carver.

Juan takes RSF (1R -> 2R, 1S -> 2S, 3F -> 4F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

No new information here, really.  Mike's Wood Carver roughly negates the extra demand for wood his Brushwood Collector introduced.

Juan's a few steps toward an early Well, with baking options open.  If Juan's reading this, he knows I have Guildmaster, so he could go for snatching the resource to food conversion majors.  Guildmaster is annoying to use and I probably won't play him anyway.

SP is open, and I have enough wood for a Raft, which I can use to get started collecting reed, as mentioned earlier.

Juan's got too much of a head start on stone for me to try to rush a Well, which I think is generally a very strong play.  If RSF stays open, I'd probably use the stone for an Axe.  

It will be interesting to see who, if anyone, will take the 4 clay next round.  I'm in position to block and upgrade my Fireplace to the 4 clay Cooking Hearth.  Anyone taking the 4 clay, I'd take as an indicator of intent to bake, with Gareth seeming the most likely right now, using the vegetables from the Greengrocer as an added value.  

The fact that the first Fireplace is already built makes the 4 clay less appealing, and makes baking easier.  The fact that Gareth's at 0 food right now makes this seem extra likely.  The low clay demand means he has fair odds of taking RSF for his first action, and being able to take the 4 clay with his second.  It's a slightly risky play, though, because he could get blocked on Major/Minor in round 4, and fair odds Mike would go for the 3 food on Traveling Players in round 3.  

This is a lot of speculation, though.  Worst case, Gareth is sitting on 2 food from eating raw grain and veg, so he can take Day Laborer, or another G and V, and be safe, but it would be crap efficiency of actions.

But, again, watching the clay will tell me the most about what's going on at this point.

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Starting Player, pay 2 wood to build Raft (3W -> 1W).
</div>


## Round 3

Action revealed: *1 Sheep*

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Sheep revealed, which means collecting a pair to breed will be possible, at least for Gareth, before first harvest.  This isn't a huge consequence either way, but I've got a possible 4 food play in round 4.

Figure I might be able to get 3 wood for my second play.  Maybe pay 1 for an occupation.  Intentions are still murky this early in the game.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 3 food, bonus reed from Fishing (3F -> 6F, 0R -> 1R)
</div>

Gareth takes 4 clay (0C -> 4C).

Mike takes 3 wood from the 1W space (3W -> 6W).

Juan gets 1 food to play Stone Carver (4F -> 5F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

Gareth, historically, really likes Cooking Hearths.  More than he should.  It's no skin off my back if he builds one, though, and I can take the sheep as a reaction if he does, which will give me a good surplus to use Animal Breeder, and I can take the other Cooking Hearth.  So I won't bother blocking.  I figure he's going for the Clay Oven, though.  If he takes RSF next, it confirms it.  He's directly to my left, so there's no weird starting player chance he makes a Cooking Hearth and takes sheep before I can act.

Mike taking wood is consistent with Brushwood Collector.  Probably going for a double room.  I don't know how he plans to feed.  I could get Street Musician out and probably get grain for it immediately.  Normally, it's a fairly lousy occ, but I have Raft, which keeps the food on the board low, while I collect food and reed from fishing.  I also have the first Fireplace, and sheep came out relatively late, so feeding options are a little slim.  Traveling Players will be pretty attractive.  I need a few occs to get Goose Pond into play, so I think I'm going to do that.  The other thing I was considering was taking 3 wood, so I could try to play Animal Breeder and fence next round.

Juan playing Stone Carver either means he wants to rush out occs for some power minor improvement, or he needs a bunch of food for some reason in short order, but he's already got enough for harvest, so who knows.  If I had to guess, I'd guess he's got Quarry, and it's a good complement.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Pay 1 food to play Street Musician (6F -> 5F).
</div>

Gareth pays 4 clay for a Cooking Hearth (4C -> 0C).

Mike takes 3 food from Traveling Players (2F -> 5F).  I receive 1 grain from Street Musician (0G -> 1G).

Juan takes 3 wood from the 3 wood space (4W -> 7W).

## Round 4

Action revealed: *Sow/Bake*

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

I can't be surprised that Gareth played Cooking Hearth, given his history.  With Greengrocer, it's not bad.  He can cook vegetables for 3 food, and bake for 3, and eat animals.  I'd have baked and kept my vegetable for planting if I were him, but we'll see how it works out.  1 grain for 5 food is really efficient, and Greengrocer is strong enough to support it, and with another player (me) going for animals already, that's going to be a crowded space.

I read it wrong, though.  The mini pasture was a strong indicator toward a hearth.

Nothing surprising about Mike's or Juan's plays.

There are 2 sheep available, and if Gareth got them, it would be too easy for him to feed for a long time, so even if I didn't want them to fund my Animal Breeder, it would be worth taking to keep Gareth from running away with the game.

This isn't a personal thing against Gareth, but part of playing a game with 3 opponents is keeping them all in check, so none of them get a huge advantage.  Going out of your way to block one opponent gives an opening to your other opponents, but if one is more ahead than the others, this is justified.  **A good game is one where your opponents all have around the same score, and yours is higher.**

Juan's in good position, with enough resources to build a room, and safe food in his supply.  I can't do anything to directly mess with him.  He's moderately vulnerable to starving later, but he's probably got some occs in hand that will help him out.  If he's going to eat stone, Well is still in consideration.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 2 sheep, cook 1 (5F -> 7F, 1 sheep in house).
</div>

Gareth takes 4 wood (0W -> 4W).

Mike builds a wooden room for 5 wood (6W -> 1W, 2 wooden rooms -> 3 wooden rooms).

Juan gets 1 food to play Market Crier (5F -> 6F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

Nothing surprising here.  I can expect to get more grain from Juan's Market Crier, and Gareth can't really count on the take 1 grain space being competition free so he can get vegetables all the time.  

Mike's room isn't a bad play, as taking more turns to get more wood, going for 2 rooms would leave him pretty vulnerable to getting starved.  If FG comes out next round, he's got dibs, and he has a lot of time to get his food sorted out.  With a hearth and FP in play already, and 0 sheep on the board right now, he might need to bake, or supplement taking Traveling Players with something from his hand if he has it.

I need some more wood.  If Juan's eating stone, I actually have good options for getting the Well, because I have Stone Exchange, which is a good way to snipe the Well from someone who gathers 3 stone and sits on it, thinking they have the Well locked.  If I get RSF, that's a good option.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 3 wood from the 3 wood space (1W -> 4W).
</div>

Gareth takes RSF (2R -> 3R, 0S -> 1S, 0F -> 1F).

Mike takes 4 clay (0C -> 4C).

Juan plows a field (0 fields -> 1 field).

## Stage 1 Harvest

I feed 4 food, directly (5F -> 1F).

Gareth cooks a vegetable, feeds 4 (1F -> 0F, 1V -> 0V).

Mike feeds 4 (5F -> 4F).

Juan feeds 4 (6F -> 2F).


## Round 5

Action revealed: *1 Stone*

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

No new information from other people's turns, really.

RSF is attractive, because I'll need 2 reed for my room eventually, and it will let me build an Axe, or the Well, if I use Stone Exchange and pay with wood.  

Juan didn't eat his stone, which he can only do at harvest time.  If he really wants the Well, he can take 1 stone, and build it with his second action.

The Well is very good, but I'm not sure it's worth doing that at this point.

The thing about points from improvements is that it's something your opponents can't have.  Going into the end of the game, if you have the same number of points, but you got them all from improvements, and your farm sucks, you can take the things you're missing, and get 2 points every turn.  If your opponent's farm is great, but they don't have a ton of resources to make improvements on the spot, they're going to have a harder time adding points.

The Well gives you a very good return on your resources, but if you grabbed the resources one at a time, it's not a good return on your actions.  The same applies to renovations.  They're good if you see a huge pile of clay or stone just sitting there, but if you have to claw for them, you're better off just plowing a couple fields or something.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take RSF (1R -> 2R, 0S -> 1S, 1F -> 2F).
</div>

Gareth takes 3 wood from the 3 wood space (4W -> 3W).

Mike builds the 3 clay Fireplace (4C -> 1C).

Juan plows a field (1 field -> 2 fields).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

Juan not building his room when Gareth has enough materials, and with his food needs covered is probably an error.  Setting up crops is annoying, and with Market Crier, arguably unnecessary.

At this point, I can't get a room built and grow my family before this harvest.  FG isn't out yet, and Mike has a room already, and can't really be food blocked.  Gareth can build a room this round, and is likely to do so.  If I take SP, I basically hand FG to Gareth, which I'm not interested in doing.  He can feed more easily than Mike, so it's better for managing my opponents to give Mike the family lead.  Mike doesn't have any fences or stables or anything, so he has some catching up to do.

So at this point, my priorities are getting cows up and breeding, so I can double expand later with the Axe, and possibly rushing out a Well.

If I don't do the Stone Exchange now, though, Juan has the option of taking stone with his first action, and building the Well with his second, but it seems like he probably wants the Stone Oven.

The Well isn't that high on my priorities.  Animal Breeder gives me plenty of points, so long as I leave enough time to use it repeatedly.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Pay 1 food to play Animal Breeder (2F -> 1F).
</div>

Gareth builds a room and 1 stable, inside his fences (7W -> 0W, 2 wood rooms -> 3 wood rooms).

Mike takes 1 sheep (0 sheep -> 1 sheep).

Juan takes starting player and builds a Riding Plow (7W -> 3W).

## Round 6

Action revealed: *Renovation*

Juan takes 4 reed (2R -> 6R).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

If Mike wanted sheep, it seems like he'd have been better off taking SP, and getting two of them, in case Family Growth didn't show up, and possibly getting some minor.  I don't know what would motivate him to do that.

I don't know why Juan plowed 2 fields manually, and then built a Riding Plow.  Nobody needs 8 fields.  These are really weird plays.

I want to build fences, and get a pair of cows to breed, but that costs 3 food, and then I need 4 food to feed my family so I don't have to eat my cows, so I'm going to take fishing.  This also makes Traveling Players more attractive, so I can get more grain eventually.

There's going to be a little bit of stumbling over each other for food.  Juan appears to want to plant a million crops, and Gareth probably wants to eat another vegetable, and might want to bake to cover his growth.  If Gareth takes SP with his first action to get the first Family Growth, he risks getting blocked on the take grain space, and then he wouldn't have the freedom to grow.  I'd probably take food I don't need to keep Gareth from growing first.  His position would be too strong otherwise.
</div>

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 3 + 1 food from fishing (1F -> 5F).
</div>

Gareth takes 1 grain + 1 vegetable (1G -> 2G, 0V -> 1V).

Mike pays 1 food to play Outrider (1F -> 0F).

Juan takes 6 clay (0C -> 6C).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts </p>

Mike not taking SP is probably an error.  Outrider is kind of a goofy, unreliable occupation, made particularly less valuable by the fact that Juan played Market Crier, so he's getting free grain already.  I kind of regret that I played Street Musician, but I had no way to know Market Crier was coming out at the time.

It seems possible Mike's trying to get Animal Yard out or something with his family growth.

Nobody else has the capability to fence right now, so I can put it off.  That means I'm free to take the 2 stone that's accumulated, and try to build the Well and fence and get a pair of breeding cows next round.

There's a fringe chance that Mike takes wood with his second action, after Gareth takes SP, and Mike could fence before I get a chance, and that would suck, but it's low odds.  Mike wouldn't be able to get a pair of breeding animals, so there wouldn't really be a payoff for him.
