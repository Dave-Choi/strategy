<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Veterinarian and Cabinetmaker are terrible, so they're gone right off the bat.  Likewise for Clay Deposit.  Axe and Clay Supports are kind of at odds with each other.  Axe only lets you make cheap wooden rooms, and Clay Supports are only good after renovating to clay.  I'd rather have the one that lets me get rooms earlier and saves me wood, so Clay Supports are gone.  Yeoman Farmer is only really good if you're going with some sort of super gimmick, or playing badly, in which case you're losing anyway.  I almost never keep him, unless I have Braggart.

Animal Breeder is very strong, and combined with Milking Hand, I have something I can use for a slow drip of food every harvest, if I fence early and get a pair of cows.  Early breeding cows are strong in general, and getting bonus food for keeping them is pretty good.  Axe makes fencing early viable, because I'll only need 2 wood per room.  Axe is also fairly easy to play in a 4 player game, because of the Reed/Stone/Food action.  This is going to be the core of my stategy.  

Animal Breeder is a strong ranching occupation, but I might go baking, because Sack Cart and Street Musician, but I probably won't play Street Musician.  It's not very strong, but if someone gets stuck without a food engine, you can kind of feed off of their desperation with it.

I'm playing in last position, so it's a good idea to have a minor improvement I can play for free, or close to free, so I can take starting player in the first round, and I don't really like Corn Sheaf, but I have a hand that could work for baking, and having the grain get passed around works more in favor of me as a baker than it does for ranchers.

But it's going to depend on the opportunities that arise.  If I can get a lot of clay early, I'm perfectly happy to ranch, and use the Broom to do something else.  Fair odds, I just play Goose Pond, Axe, and maybe Raft, and chuck everything else.

Even with Stone Exchange flooding the game with stone, I probably still won't have enough for Bakehouse, so discard it.

I think overall, having a few pass to the left minors (Corn Sheaf, Stone Exchange), is pretty good in combination with Broom, because I get initiative using them, and get to draw to replace them.

## Round 1

Action revealed: *Major/Minor Improvement*

Gareth plays Greengrocer.

Mike takes 3 wood (0W -> 3W).

Juan pays 1 food to play Patron (3F -> 2F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Gareth is going for early vegetables, and Juan played Patron.  Patron begs you to rush out occupations.  I anticipate Gareth is looking to combo with something like Schnapps Distiller, or Lettuce Patch, which requires 3 occupations to play.  So I anticipate a lot of competition over occupations early game, which should leave me fairly free to take resources that I need to get my housing and food engine started.

When Major/Minor comes out on the first round, a clay grab is safe, because there's no chance weird timing will allow someone else to grab clay and build a Fireplace before you have a chance to build it first.

My Animal Dealer plan requires a good amount of food to get started, so first Fireplace would be an asset.

Normally, you need wood or an occupation to get a good round 1 starting player action, but I have Corn Sheaf, so I'm okay with taking the clay, but I'll probably get stuck choosing between plowing a field and Day Laborer.  Chances are Mike's going to take starting player and make something out of wood, like a Fishing Rod or something.

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Action</p>
Take 2 clay.
</div>


Gareth takes Starting Player, pays 2 food for Mini Pasture (2F -> 0F).

Mike plows a field (0 -> 1 field).

Juan takes RSF (reed/stone/food) (0R -> 1R, 0S -> 1S, 2F -> 3F).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Normally, I'd sit on my clay for a while, as a deterrent to anyone else even thinking about taking clay, possibly opening the door for me to get a big clay grab later, but Gareth played Mini Pasture, so he can grab sheep and then try to figure out how to cook them later, so I have to have a Fireplace ready ahead of time and might have to grab them at as low as a pair, instead of letting them pile up for a while.

I don't know what to think about Mike plowing a field.  The options weren't terribly attractive, but RSF is generally more appealing.  I have to guess he wants to bake, or has Hobby Farmer, or something that will give him early vegetables.

Can't make anything of Juan taking RSF.  It's just a good all around option for the 7th action in the round.

Mini Pasture changes the game dynamic a fair amount.  Demand for wood ends up being a lot lower over the course of the game, since it's generating 16 wood if we all just use it once.  If it comes around fast enough, I might skip playing Axe.  Demand for food will be higher, too, though.  I might have to fight for a pair of sheep off the board.

Personally, I like to play Starting Player (SP) Mini Pasture when I want to use the starting player action to grab animals.  This kind of projection, on top of being starting player already is a little weird.  If I had to read something from it, I'd guess reed is important to Gareth.  Could be foreshadowing a Reed Hut.  I love Reed Hut, unless my opponents have it, in which case, I hate Reed Hut.

## Round 2

Action revealed: *Build Fences*

Gareth takes 2 reed (0R -> 2R).

Mike plays Brushwood Collector.

Juan takes 4 wood (0W -> 4W).

<div class="well" markdown="1">
<p class="lead">Thoughts</p>

Mike's Brushwood Collector reduces the demand for reed, increases it slightly for wood, but overall works for him, with Mini Pasture in play.

Pretty normal plays.  I need to start collecting building resources.  If the opportunity presents itself, I can take SP with my second action and build a Raft and take 3 food and a reed.

If someone else takes SP, I can probably plow a field or something, to get ready to use my Corn Sheaf.  Planting in Stage 1 can set you up for supplementing late game with an oven, or emergency bakes in a Cooking Hearth.  If you get stuck playing in late position, it's not a bad option.

I don't think I'm going to have another opportunity at an occupation for a little bit, but I can't put off taking resources.  The sheep haven't shown up yet, so I don't think there's going to be a huge rush to use the Mini Pasture, so I'll need a bunch of wood if I want to use Animal Dealer.
