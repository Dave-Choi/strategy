Veterinarian and Cabinetmaker are terrible, so they're gone right off the bat.  Likewise for Clay Deposit.  Axe and Clay Supports are kind of at odds with each other.  Axe only lets you make cheap wooden rooms, and Clay Supports are only good after renovating to clay.  I'd rather have the one that lets me get rooms earlier and saves me wood, so Clay Supports are gone.  Yeoman Farmer is only really good if you're going with some sort of super gimmick, or playing badly, in which case you're losing anyway.  I almost never keep him, unless I have Braggart.

Animal Breeder is very strong, and combined with Milking Hand, I have something I can use for a slow drip of food every harvest, if I fence early and get a pair of cows.  Early breeding cows are strong in general, and getting bonus food for keeping them is pretty good.  Axe makes fencing early viable, because I'll only need 2 wood per room.  Axe is also fairly easy to play in a 4 player game, because of the Reed/Stone/Food action.  This is going to be the core of my stategy.  

Animal Breeder is a strong ranching occupation, but I might go baking, because Sack Cart and Street Musician, but I probably won't play Street Musician.  It's not very strong, but if someone gets stuck without a food engine, you can kind of feed off of their desperation with it.

I'm playing in last position, so it's a good idea to have a minor improvement I can play for free, or close to free, so I can take starting player in the first round, and I don't really like Corn Sheaf, but I have a hand that could work for baking, and having the grain get passed around works more in favor of me as a baker than it does for ranchers.

But it's going to depend on the opportunities that arise.  If I can get a lot of clay early, I'm perfectly happy to ranch, and use the Broom to do something else.  Fair odds, I just play Goose Pond, Axe, and maybe Raft, and chuck everything else.

Even with Stone Exchange flooding the game with stone, I probably still won't have enough for Bakehouse, so discard it.

I think overall, having a few pass to the left minors (Corn Sheaf, Stone Exchange), is pretty good in combination with Broom, because I get initiative using them, and get to draw to replace them.
